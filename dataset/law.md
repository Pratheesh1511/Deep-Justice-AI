Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder —If the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, orIf it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused. orIf it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, orIf the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.IllustrationsA shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder.A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature.

This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A’ deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.A attempts to pull Z’ nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B’ rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B’ hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.Exception 2Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence or person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.IllustrationsZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.Exception 3Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.Exception 4Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender’ having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.ExplanationsIt is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.Exception 5Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.IllustrationsA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z’ youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder.

### Indian Penal Code and Section 378:- Theft
Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person’ consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.ExplanationsA thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth.A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft.A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied.IllustrationsA cuts down a tree on Z’ ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z’ possession without Z’ consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’ dog to follow it. Here, if A’ intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’ possession without Z’ consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z’ dog has begun to follow A.A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.A being Z’ servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’ plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z’ consent. A has committed theft.Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’ possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z’ possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z’ possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.A finds a ring lying on the high-road, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’ house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z’ hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’ possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’ possession without Z’ consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’ possession without Z’ consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft.A being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’ library in Z’ absence, and takes away a book without Z’ express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’ implied consent to use Z’ book. If this was A’ impression, A has not committed theft.A asks charity from Z’ wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’ wife is authorized to give away alms. If this was A’ impression, A has not committed theft.A is the paramour of Z’ wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’ own property, takes that property out of B’ possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.

Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission, the error shall not be regarded as material.A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge, or is set out incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the-charge. There were many transactions between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no defence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a material error.A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 1882.

### Code of Criminal Procedure 2218 and Section 217 – Recall of witnesses when charge altered
Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the Court after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed-to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness who may have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers that the prosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, desires to recall or re-examine such witness for the purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice;also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.
